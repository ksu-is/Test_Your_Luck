    I viewed a repository about a magic 8-ball game which gives you random fortunes. 
    I figured that you could add ramifications and data to it to generate whether you would have good luck or bad luck based off of age, zodiac, date & time, and the seriousness of the action. 
    I have ran the file and see that it just provides one of a few answers. so making mine actually calculate the answer instead of being a randomly generated one will be tough. 
    I will make all of the categories have % of luck that will all calculate to final luck.
